# OutlookPackageTracker


This is package tracking web aplication for online shoppers.

When people shop online, they often receive tracking number along with their order.
Each vendor sends one tracking number per order and if the shopper has more then 2 tracking numbers, they would have to do multiple searches.
In order to reduce multiple searches, I developed this application, Outpacktrack, which shows brief tracking informations.

Outpacktrack, requires login to actual, existing outlook.com e-mail and permission to read e-mails.
